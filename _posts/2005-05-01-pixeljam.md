Description {#description}
------------

Low resolution entertainment for high resolution people.



HISTORY   {#history}
-----------

Pixeljam was created in 2005 as a creative outlet for low resolution art and animation. Shortly after its founding members, Rich Grillotti and Miles Tilmann, decided to fulfill a lifelong dream and make games instead, carried by the momentum of the flourishing scene at the time.  After a lot of self-education and determination, the browser game "Gamma Bros" was born.

After being nominated in the 2007 Independent Game Festival for best web game, Miles and Rich decided to dive head first into game development and call it their full time job. The web classic Dino Run was released next, followed by a multitude of smaller games made for Adult Swim.

"Potatoman Seeks the Troof" followed next, and most recently "Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork", a collaboration with cartoonist James Kochalka.

### What makes Pixeljam tick?

An insatiable desire to explore the outer limits of the low-resolution / pixelated style in games, art, and music.


Current   {#current}
-------------------

Pixeljam is working on a remake of Dino Run for Steam, Potatoman for iOS / Android / Steam, and Glorkian Warrior for Android / Mac / PC.

Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork is a collaboration between acclaimed comic book artist James Kochalka and indie game studio Pixeljam. It's a unique hybrid of Galaga-style shoot 'em up, simple platforming action and Saturday morning cartoon. Help Glorkian Warrior defend his asteroid against an endless onslaught of alien invaders, and be prepared for somewhat unexpected results...

In a world where the Troof is an unanswered question, Potatoman quests through the riddle. Through desert wastelands, thick forests, and dystopian cities, nothing is what it seems. With only his wits, his jump, and a question, Potatoman must potato forth through quirky and challenging platforming puzzles! Jump, run, and engage in humorous potatosophical debate as your avatar dies a thousand deaths... encounter spud-shredding baddies and quick platformer pacing in this new Pixeljam release. Dont end up a potato pancake... go forward and seek the Troof!

A Giant asteroid has crash landed and extinction may just be inevitable. You are a Velociraptor -- and you should probably start running for your life! Run, jump, catch a ride with a Pterodactyl, eat power-up plants & other things, save all the dino eggs you can!

Jump into the multiplayer and test your speed against your fellow dinos as you race for glory -- and to avoid extinction!

>...the conclusion is beautiful in its use of game mechanics to make the player feel a loss of ability. By making old obstacles suddenly seem impossible, it shows the player what it feels like to surrender oneself to encroaching inevitability, to just give up and embrace what’s coming.

>Dino Run is the kind of game that reminds you why you started playing games for the first time... It's pure, simple, its premise has that certain geektastic wetness that games used to
have before they sold out for every shade of brown and two flavors of protagonist.
