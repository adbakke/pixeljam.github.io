It's a unique hybrid of Galaga-style shoot 'em up, simple platforming action and Saturday morning cartoon.Help Glorkian Warrior defend his asteroid against an endless onslaught of alien invaders, and be prepared for somewhat unexpected results...

In early 2010, in an age before crowdfunding was a universally recognized concept, Pixeljam successfuly ran a Kickstarter campaign with James Kochalka to raise funds for an idea called Glorkian Warrior. After years of experiments, iterations and trials, we are proud to introduce the Glorkian universe to the world in compact, mobile-friendly comedic endless shooter.

Procedurally generated aerial invader flight patterns and formations of the Galaxian persuasion.A wicked arsenal of weapons and power ups, including tennis balls and the legendary "Flarf Gun". A simple and refreshing mobile presentation: No IAP, no complicated leveling-up systems, just good old fashioned entertainment like your great grandpa used to enjoy.

History   {#history}
--------

In early 2010, in an age before crowdfunding was a universally recognized concept, Pixeljam successfuly ran a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/james-kochalka-pixeljam-glorkian-warrior) campaign with James Kochalka to raise funds for an idea called Glorkian Warrior.  We were able to raise $11,200 with a goal of $10,000.

There were several iterations of the game including a mini-game featuring Glork's pixellated sidekick, Glorkbot. Most of these made it only as far as the Pixeljam vault.

After all these experiments, iterations and trials, we presented the Glorkian Universe to the world in our compact, mobile-friendly comedic endless shooter.









Future Plans
------------

With only iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch versions available at the present Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork is being developed for PC, Mac, and Android. Pixeljam is working with Noodlecake Games to release the Android version.

We presently have no plans to bring Glorkian Warrior to any other platforms though it's not out of the question.

Quotes   {#quotes}

> Potatoman will delight, surprise, and challenge you. I had so much fun playing through his little adventure,
and I know I'll replay it many times in the future. And the ending is amazing! Definitely play all the way to the end.

> > *-James Kochalka*, [American Elf](http://americanelf.com/)


>Potatoman is an awesome bite-sized platformer that is as fun as it is, well, insane.

> > *-Northernlion*, [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion)


>Good, addictive fun, with a nice balance between level-memorization and hand-eye coordination.

> > *-Cory Doctorow*, [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/07/potatoman-seeks-the-troof-fun.html)


>...the conclusion is beautiful in its use of game mechanics to make the player feel a loss of ability. By making old obstacles suddenly seem impossible, it shows the player what it feels like to surrender oneself to encroaching inevitability, to just give up and embrace what’s coming.

> > *-Travis Pynenburg*, [Pure Sophistry](http://www.puresophistry.com/2013/01/28/potatoman-sought-the-troof-i-didnt-get-it/)


>Potatoman has the Best jump in the history of video games, seriously.
