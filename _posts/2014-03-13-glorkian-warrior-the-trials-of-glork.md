After years of experiments, iterations and trials, we are proud to introduce the Glorkian universe to the world in compact, mobile-friendly comedic endless shooter.

Procedurally generated aerial invader flight patterns and formations of the Galaxian persuasion.A wicked arsenal of weapons and power ups, including tennis balls and the legendary "Flarf Gun".

History   {#history}
--------

In early 2010, in an age before crowdfunding was a universally recognized concept, Pixeljam successfuly ran a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/james-kochalka-pixeljam-glorkian-warrior) campaign with James Kochalka to raise funds for an idea called Glorkian Warrior.  We were able to raise $11,200 with a goal of $10,000.

There were several iterations of the game including a mini-game featuring Glork's pixellated sidekick, Glorkbot. Most of these made it only as far as the Pixeljam vault.

After all these experiments, iterations and trials, we presented the Glorkian Universe to the world in our compact, mobile-friendly comedic endless shooter.









Future Plans
------------

With only iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch versions available at the present Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork is being developed for PC, Mac, and Android. Pixeljam is working with Noodlecake Games to release the Android version.

We presently have no plans to bring Glorkian Warrior to any other platforms though it's not out of the question.
