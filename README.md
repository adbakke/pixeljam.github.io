Indie Presskit 0.9b
========

This is the Pixeljam Presskit, a resource for anyone involved in the press (blogs or any media) to quickly get information, assets, et cetera about our company, games, and projects.

This is basically just a Jekyll Template that we are using for all of our press kits for different games.

Use it or change it, just let me know so I can check out what you've done with the work I've done on it.

There will be a general Indie Presskit available once I get around to boiling out all the Pixeljam-specific elements and optimizing so *anyone* can edit a press kit, add images, etc.
